# Project 2 - Juana V. and Gabby C.
Project 2 focuses on enhancing the code and visualizations developed in Project 1. The primary goal is to improve code quality, introduce new functionality, and ensure adherence to best coding practices. Participants can work independently or collaborate with a partner. The project involves creating one or two data visualizations based on a dataset of choice, improving upon Project 1 or starting fresh with a new dataset.
This project includes a data set on climate change and its impact on agriculture. This data set provides data on crop type, average temperature, total precipitation, CO2 emissions, corp yield, extreme weather events, economic impact, soil health index, fertilizer and pesticide use.
To run project you need R and Rstudio
For best results follow these guidelines:
- Ensure the dataset is correctly formatted and placed in the data/ folder.

- Run the analysis.R script before the visualization.R script to prepare the data.

- Use the latest version of R and RStudio for compatibility.
